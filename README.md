Stagelink frontend developer assignment
=======================================

Your assignment is to add categories to this sample TODO app.
You can implement it in any way you want as long as you satifsy following requirements:

1. I want to be able to see all todos regardless of category
2. I want to be able to see todos belonging a single particular category
3. All/active/completed filter should work together with category selection
4. Styling of caterogy controls matches the rest of the app

You can see this app live at https://frost-mustang.hyperdev.space

Good luck!
